# Create React App with Typescript

Use with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for Typescript React App.

*WARNNING:* This package has only been used on my personal projects, that said it *doesn't* have proper releasing and documentations. Welcome to play around and let me know what you think that can be done better!

There are better options, such as [react-scripts-ts](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

## Usage

Create React App with configs in this fork:

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=zc-react-scripts
cs my-app/
npm start
```

To update the configs to latest version:
```sh
npm update zc-react-scripts
```

## Additional Features

We intended to minimize changes against the original repository, however there are features we would like to have but not provided. Also some Typescript related features.

### CSS Modules

We have added [postcss-cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) webpack plugin to support the latest CSS syntax, and the type definition of the CSS modules will be generated by [typed-css-modules](https://github.com/Quramy/typed-css-modules) with a simple webpack loader.

You may notice that we added a step to the build pipeline that generates the CSS module type definitions before invoking webpack, where this looks like a duplicate step with the webpack loader. This is because webpack will feed the loaded files to each loader, which does not contains any of the CSS modules' type definitions as they will be generated by the loader.
