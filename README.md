# Create React App with Typescript

Use with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for Typescript React App.

## Upgrade checklist

We only modify the project to support Typescript with necessary changes, so that we can easily keep up-to-date with the original repository. However, since we also renamed some templates' extension to `.ts | .tsx`, which can be easily missed out.

- Check any update on `registerServiceWorker`
